Django make use of **named group** in regular expression to extract the pattern string into a variable group, that can be passes as a parameter list into a view function. Python regular expressions identify named groups with the text `(?P<name>pattern)` , where name is the name of the group and pattern is the actual regular expression pattern. In a URL pattern, Django takes any named group and passes its value to the view the URL pattern points to. Consider the example\n",
