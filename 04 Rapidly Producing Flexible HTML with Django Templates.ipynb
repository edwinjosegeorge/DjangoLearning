    "* Django also supplies `{#` and  `#}`, which is used to write comments in templates. The utility of using template comments over markup-specific comments is that they will not appear in the output of the rendered templates. This further allows for a separation of comments specific to the template code from comments specific to markup code.\n",
    "* In addition to printing variables and providing template tags for logic, templates provide the ability to interact with variables via template filters. Template filters allow developers to sort, modify, and count lists; to format a Python date object into a pretty string; and to modify strings, such as to change their case. Django template filters may be applied to a variable by appending a vertical bar character, or pipe, to the variable followed by the name of the filter (and any arguments the filter might take): `{{ variable|filter }}`. Spaces between the variable, vertical bar, and filter name are not welcome. Some filters allow or expect a single argument, which may be passed in with a colon and enclosed in quotations if the argument is not an integer: `{{ variable|filter:\"arg\" }}`. Filters may also be chained: `{{ variable|filter1|filter2 }}`"
